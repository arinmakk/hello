# HEAP G15 

## Overview

University students usually lack the time and capacity to constantly review whatever they have been taught throughout the semester. 
Majority of the time, they only compile/review/revise their notes when a test/exam is approaching. This leads to stress and last minute cramming which might not be very productive.

QuizGen hopes to better utilise studentâ€™s notes and integrate learning techniques such as spaced repetition and active recall into their daily lives seamlessly through pop-up questions.
We target University students who want to familiarise themselves with the content in class but do not have the time and capacity to do so by themselves.
